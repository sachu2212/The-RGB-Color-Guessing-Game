# The-RGB-Color-Guessing-Game
The RGB Color Guessing Game is a game in which user has to choose the correct color corresponding to the random RGB code.
In this project, I wanted to create an in-browser game which learned using JavaScript DOM manipulation and tied together my knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3. 
Play the game here: https://sachu2212.github.io/The-RGB-Color-Guessing-Game/

Game Instructions:
The player must guess what RGB color number in order to win the game. 
There are 2 modes: Easy and Hard. 
RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue. This a a color model in which red, green and blue and mixed together in various way reproduce a broad range of colors. 
A color in the RGB color model is described by indicating how much of each of the red, green, and blue is included. The color is expressed as an RGB triplet (r,g,b).  
The values to produce new colors are often stored as integer numbers in the range 0 to 255.

E.g.  Red would be RGB (255, 0 , 0)
      Green would be RGB (0, 255 , 0)
      Blue would be RGB (0 , 0 , 255)
